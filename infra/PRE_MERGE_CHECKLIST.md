# Pre-merge checklist — PR #5 (Supabase → self-hosted Postgres/Coolify/Hetzner + Cloudflare)

**Do not merge `migrate/postgres-coolify-hetzner` into `main` until every item below is checked.** Vercel auto-deploys `main`, and `web/` on this branch no longer talks to Supabase at all — merging early breaks the live site at nrighar.3pandalabs.com. Work through this top to bottom; each section links to the doc with the actual commands.

## 1. Provision the Hetzner server ✅ DONE 2026-07-20

- [x] `hcloud` CLI installed and authenticated (`hcloud context create nrighar`)
- [x] Filled in `MY_IP_CIDR` and ran `infra/hetzner/provision-server.sh` (corrected two wrong assumptions while running: server type `cx22` doesn't exist in Singapore, closest available is `cpx22`; location code is `sin`, not `sin1`)
- [x] Server public IPv4: **`5.223.94.207`** (SSH: `ssh root@5.223.94.207`)

→ `infra/README.md` §1–2, `infra/hetzner/provision-server.sh`

## 2. Cloudflare R2 buckets

- [ ] Create `nrighar-documents` bucket (private)
- [ ] Create `nrighar-backups` bucket (private)
- [ ] Create a single scoped R2 API token covering both buckets (decided 2026-07-20), save Account ID / Access Key ID / Secret Access Key
- [ ] Verify the token/bucket/endpoint with the `aws s3 ls --endpoint-url ...` check in the doc

→ `infra/r2-setup.md`

## 3. Install Coolify + deploy resources

- [x] SSH into the Hetzner server (`ssh root@5.223.94.207`), ran the Coolify installer (v4.1.2) — DONE 2026-07-20
- [ ] Open `http://5.223.94.207:8000` immediately, create the admin account (must be done by Anil/Prachi directly — not something to delegate)
- [ ] Add the **Postgres 17** database resource, copy its generated password / internal connection string
- [ ] Configure scheduled Postgres backups pointing at the `nrighar-backups` R2 bucket, confirm a manual "Backup now" actually lands an object
- [ ] Add the **`nrighar-api`** application resource (build context `api/`, Dockerfile `api/Dockerfile`), set env vars: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET` (fresh, `openssl rand -base64 48` — never reuse anything Supabase-related), `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET=nrighar-documents`, `R2_ENDPOINT`, `PORT`
- [ ] Add the DNS A record: `api.nrighar.3pandalabs.com` → the server's public IPv4, **DNS-only (grey cloud)** on Cloudflare
- [ ] Deploy `nrighar-api`, confirm Coolify's Traefik issued a valid Let's Encrypt cert and `https://api.nrighar.3pandalabs.com/health` returns `200`
- [ ] Confirm port 5432 is NOT reachable from the public internet (`nc -zv <public-ip> 5432` should fail from another machine)

→ `infra/coolify-setup.md`

## 4. Run the schema migration against the new Postgres

- [ ] From `api/`, run the Drizzle migration (`npm run db:migrate` or equivalent — check `api/package.json`) against the new `DATABASE_URL` to create all 13 tables before any data lands

## 5. Migrate the data

- [ ] Fill in `scripts/.env.example` → `.env` with real Supabase + new-Postgres + R2 credentials
- [ ] Dry run first (default, no `--confirm`) — inspect the row-count report
- [ ] Run for real with `--confirm` (and `--truncate-first` only if re-running after a failed attempt)
- [ ] Spot-check: a handful of documents open correctly via `POST /storage/presign-download` against the new API; one full login → dashboard → tenant-doc-view smoke test

→ `scripts/README.md`

## 6. Deploy the web frontend to Cloudflare

- [ ] `npm install` in `web/` on a clean Linux/CI environment (the local Windows dev box hit an unrelated `@ast-grep/napi` native-binding issue blocking a full local build — confirm this isn't an issue in CI)
- [ ] Run `npm run cf:preview` (or `cf:deploy` when ready) — confirm the OpenNext Cloudflare build actually completes now that `src/proxy.ts` has been removed (this was the blocker; see the PR description)
- [ ] Set `JWT_SECRET` as a Worker secret (`npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET`) — same value as the API's, since the web app verifies access-token signatures itself in `dashboard/layout.tsx`/`tenant/layout.tsx`
- [ ] Point the Worker at the custom domain `nrighar.3pandalabs.com` (repointing from the current Vercel CNAME — this is the moment the live site's DNS actually changes)
- [ ] Full manual smoke test against production: login (owner + tenant), dashboard CRUD, document upload/view, pay-link flow, intake-link flow, profile-share claim + revoke-then-verify-cutoff

## 7. Ship the new mobile build

- [ ] Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the live API URL in EAS env config
- [ ] New EAS build (existing installed builds still point at Supabase and will break once it's decommissioned — coordinate so this doesn't ship before the API is actually live)

## 8. Only after all of the above are verified working end-to-end

- [ ] Merge PR #5 into `main`
- [ ] Decommission (pause first, don't delete immediately — keep a rollback window): the Vercel project's old deployment config, the Supabase project
- [ ] Update `tech-stack.md` in the `ops` repo to flip the new infra from "IN PROGRESS" to "LIVE" (this doc's counterpart already has the entries — see the PR that added them)
