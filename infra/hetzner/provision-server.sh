# Provisions the single Hetzner Cloud server for NRIGhar's Coolify host: a
# Firewall (22/80/443 only — Postgres is NEVER opened publicly, see
# infra/README.md) and the server itself.
#
# This script is meant to be READ before it's run, not executed blindly — it
# creates real, billable Hetzner resources. It is idempotent-ish (checks
# before creating where practical) so it's safe to re-run after fixing a
# variable, but it does not tear anything down for you.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - hcloud CLI installed (https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli) and
#     authenticated: `hcloud context create nrighar` (prompts for an API
#     token — create one in the Hetzner Cloud console under the project's
#     Security -> API Tokens, "Read & Write").
#   - An SSH key already uploaded to the project, OR let this script upload
#     your local public key (see SSH_KEY_NAME / SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH below).
